Hunting and shooting enthusiasts around the world remember Roy E. Weatherby for his 
ammunition and firearms innovations. Many also remember him for his steadfast 
support of wildlife conservation and ethical sport hunting. Today, Weatherby 
Foundation International helps preserve these memories and continue the man’s work 
on behalf of all hunters.

Formed in 1988, the Foundation’s objective is to educate the non-hunting public on the 
beneficial role of ethical sport hunting and its contribution to wildlife conservation. It is 
one of the few nonprofit organizations to focus its efforts and financial support on
education outside of the industry.

Active in fulfilling its mission, the Foundation has become a leading proponent and 
supporter of Outdoor Expos and, through its Outdoor Expo Campaign, is working to 
help develop and support these hands-on educational activities throughout North 
America. In addition, grants are made to non-profit organizations whose programs 
introduce people to hunting and the outdoors.

Beyond its philanthropic endeavors, the Foundation serves as the sole sponsor of the 
prestigious Weatherby Hunting and Conservation Award. First presented in 1956, the 
Weatherby Award annually recognizes an individual for outstanding support of wildlife 
conservation, lifetime hunting achievement and dedication to the principles of ethical 
sport hunting.
